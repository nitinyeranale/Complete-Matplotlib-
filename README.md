Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and
interactive visualizations in Python.

# Overview
This repository contains my practice files and exercises while learning Matplotlib, a widely used Python library for data visualization. The practice covers essential Matplotlib functionalities, including:

- Creating various types of plots
- Customizing plots with labels, titles, and legends
- Adjusting styles, colors, and markers
- Working with multiple subplots
- Adding annotations and text
- Saving and exporting plots

# Matplotlib Plots 
- **Bar chart**: Displays data with rectangular bars, where the length of each bar is proportional to the value it represents.
  
- **Scatter plot**: Visualizes the relationship between two numerical variables by plotting points on a Cartesian plane.
  
- **Histogram plot**: Shows the distribution of a dataset by grouping data into bins and plotting the frequency of data within each bin.
  
- **Pie plot**: Represents proportions of a whole, showing each category's relative size in a circular chart.
  
- **Stem plot**: Similar to a scatter plot but with lines extending from a baseline to each data point, often used for discrete data.
  
- **Box and whisker plot**: Displays the distribution of data through quartiles, showing median, upper, and lower quartiles, along with potential outliers.
  
- **Stack/area plot**: Plots multiple data series stacked on top of each other to show the cumulative total and relationships.
  
- **Fill-between plot**: Highlights the area between two plots (usually curves) to show the space or difference between them.
